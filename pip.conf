# pip.conf  (Linux / macOS)
# =========================
# This file configures pip to install all packages into the AI Helper
# install directory so they stay off the boot / home drive when space
# is limited.
#
# HOW TO ACTIVATE FOR YOUR USER ACCOUNT
# --------------------------------------
# Copy this file to one of the locations pip checks automatically:
#
#   ~/.config/pip/pip.conf          ← recommended (per-user, XDG)
#   ~/.pip/pip.conf                 ← legacy per-user location
#   /etc/pip.conf                   ← system-wide (requires root)
#
# Or run the setup helper once:
#
#   python scripts/setup_d_drive.py
#

# Adjust this path to the drive / directory that has sufficient space.
target = ~/AI-Helper/Lib/site-packages

# Keep the download cache in the same location.
cache-dir = ~/AI-Helper/pip-cache
