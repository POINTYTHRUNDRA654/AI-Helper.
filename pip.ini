# pip.ini  (Windows)
# ==================
# This file configures pip to install all packages into the AI Helper
# install directory on the D drive so that the desktop (C drive) does
# not run out of space.
#
# HOW TO ACTIVATE FOR YOUR USER ACCOUNT
# --------------------------------------
# Copy this file to one of the locations pip checks automatically:
#
#   %APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini          ← recommended (per-user, all projects)
#   %ProgramData%\pip\pip.ini      ← system-wide (requires admin)
#
# Or run the setup helper once:
#
#   python scripts\setup_d_drive.py
#
# It will copy this file to %APPDATA%\pip\pip.ini for you.
